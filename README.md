# Multi-Messenger
This is a Multi-Messenger Program written in  Python that lets you send email, Whatsapp and way2sms texts from a GUI. You have the option of spamming as well 

There are a few method calls in the code itself that have to be filled in like the email_id and password you want to spam people with. I recommend using a new ID but that is upto you.

2/3rd of the project runs on web automation. So you are going to need to download the selenium web driver for the chrome version you are using. In the code, you need to specify where the selenium driver is located(The full path). 

Feel free to contact me if you find this useful and need help in something. I will try to help you if I can 

While using mail or spam, you will have to access your gmail account settings and will have to allow "less secure" apps i.e., toggle it on if not on already. Without this, the code will not work
